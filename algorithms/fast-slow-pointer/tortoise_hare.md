## 🐢🐇 1. Tortoise and Hare (Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm)

### ✅ Purpose:

* To **detect cycles** in sequences like **linked lists**, **arrays**, or even **numeric transformations** (e.g., happy
  numbers).
* It **does not require extra space** (unlike HashSet-based approaches).

### 🧠 Core Idea:

* Two pointers:

    * `slow` moves **1 step** at a time
    * `fast` moves **2 steps** at a time
* If there's a **cycle**, fast will **eventually meet** slow.
* If there's **no cycle**, fast will reach the end (`null` or out-of-bounds).

### ✅ Applications:

* Detecting loops in linked lists
* Checking for **happy numbers**
* Detecting **repeating states** in sequences

### 💡 Example: Cycle detection in a linked list

```java
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
  ListNode slow = head;
  ListNode fast = head;

  while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;

    if (slow == fast) return true; // cycle detected
  }

  return false;
}
```

### 🔍 When to Use:

* You need to **detect or find cycles**
* You **can't afford extra space**
* You want a **deterministic and efficient** solution

## 🐢🐇 2. Slow & Fast Pointer Technique (Generalized Two Pointer Method)

### ✅ Purpose:

A **versatile pattern** used for **many types of problems** beyond cycle detection, such as:

* Finding the **middle** of a list
* Detecting **palindromes**
* Removing **Nth node from the end**
* Checking **linked list intersections**
* Solving **runner or movement problems** in arrays

### 🧠 Core Idea:

* Use two pointers moving at **different speeds**
* The **relative motion** between them gives insights (like finding the midpoint or catching up)

### ✅ Applications:

* Find **middle element** of a list
* Check if a list is **palindromic**
* Find the **length of a cycle**
* Remove **Nth node from the end**

### 💡 Example: Find middle node

```java
public ListNode findMiddle(ListNode head) {
    ListNode slow = head;
    ListNode fast = head;

    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }

    return slow;
}
```

| **Type of sequence**             | Often linked lists or numeric states | Mostly linked lists, but also arrays         |

## 🧠 Visualization of Tortoise and Hare

Suppose you have a cycle in a list:

```
A → B → C → D → E
         ↑     ↓
         H ← G ← F
```

* `slow` goes 1 node at a time: A → B → C → D
* `fast` goes 2 nodes at a time: A → C → E → G
* Eventually, `fast` catches up to `slow` inside the cycle

## 🧠 Visualization of Slow & Fast Pointers (Finding middle)

```
List: A → B → C → D → E

slow: A → B → C
fast: A → C → E → null

=> middle is C
```

## 🔚 Summary

| **Concept**         | **Use Case**               | **Is It a Subset of Other?**  |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Tortoise & Hare     | Cycle detection            | Specialized form of slow/fast |
| Slow & Fast Pointer | Versatile (mid, nth, etc.) | General technique             |

* **Tortoise & Hare** is a **specific** application of the **slow/fast pointer** strategy.
* The **slow/fast technique** is more **general**, used across a **wider variety** of problems.
